            <h1>Building a Snowless Future: Canada’s Environmental Plan for 2030</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the official page for Canada’s bold new environmental initiative: the Snow Ban of 2030. This transformative plan positions Canada as a leader in the global fight against climate change by replacing natural snow with EcoFoam, a groundbreaking, sustainable, and environmentally friendly alternative.</p>

            <h2>Why Ban Snow?</h2>
            <p>This visionary initiative addresses one of the lesser-known contributors to climate challenges: snow. While snow has long been considered a hallmark of Canadian winters, scientific research reveals its surprising environmental consequences. Snow’s reflective properties disrupt Earth’s energy balance, while the freeze-thaw cycle demands significant energy, contributing to increased carbon emissions. By introducing EcoFoam as a replacement, we can mitigate these impacts, safeguard our ecosystems, and pioneer a more sustainable future.</p>

                <h2>What is EcoFoam?</h2>
                <p>EcoFoam represents a monumental step forward in the journey toward sustainable living. Its adoption not only reduces energy consumption but also supports the development of cutting-edge green technologies. It is an innovative, human-engineered material designed to mimic the appearance, texture, and functionality of snow. Unlike snow, EcoFoam offers unparalleled environmental benefits:</p>
                <p>Benefits include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It does not melt, eliminating the need for energy-intensive snow removal.</li>
                    <li>It is 100% recyclable and non-toxic, aligning it with Canada’s commitment to sustainability.</li>
                    <li>It supports year-round usability, making it ideal for winter sports and recreation.</li>
